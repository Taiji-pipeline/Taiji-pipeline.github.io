  <h1 class="ui header">About Taiji</h1>
  <p>The Taiji pipeline aims at integrating different kinds of high throughput
      profiling techniques to construct TF regulatory networks and identify key
      regulators through network analysis. That being said,
      one only needs ATAC-seq or DNase-seq data to run the analysis,
      though the result will be better given other information,
      especially RNA-seq data.
