PBMCs include lymphocytes (T cells, B cells, and NK cells), monocytes, and dendritic cells. In humans, the frequencies of these populations vary across individuals, but typically, lymphocytes are in the range of 70–90 %, monocytes from 10 to 20 %, while dendritic cells are rare, accounting for only 1–2 %. The frequencies of cell types within the lymphocyte population include 70–85 % CD3+ T cells, 5–10 % B cells, and 5–20 % NK cells. The CD3+ lymphocytes are composed of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, roughly in a 2:1 ratio. After activation the CD4+ T cell subset may develop into diverse effector cell subsets, including Th1, Th2, Th17, Th9, Th22, follicular helper (Tfh) cells and different types of regulatory cells (Akdis et al. 2012; Crotty 2011; Tan and Gery 2012; Sakaguchi et al. 2008). The CD4+ helper T cells are essential mediators of immune homeostasis and inflammation (Hirahara et al. 2013).
