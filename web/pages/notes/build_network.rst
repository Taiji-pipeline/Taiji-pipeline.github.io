Construct TF regulatory networks
==================================

limitation of constructing networks using ChIP-seq data:

1. the availability of suitable affinity reagents.
2. the difficulty of interrogating the activities of multiple TFs within the
same cellular environment; and, perhaps most critically.
3. the sizable number of TFs and cellular states that need to be studied.

De novo network construction methods based on gene expression correlations
partly overcome the limitation of studying one TF at a time but
lack directness and typically require several hundred independent
gene expression perturbation studies to build a network
for one cell type (Basso et al., 2005; Carro et al., 2010).
